		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
		<h2>If you don't use it, you lose it!</h2>
		<p>It's true!  Without proper exercise, your cognitive capacity will decrease much the same way that muscle atrophies if unused. Try this fun and interactive way to keep up your mental fitness and defy the stereoptype of "aging"!   </p>
